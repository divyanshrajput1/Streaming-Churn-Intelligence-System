An end-to-end distributed streaming + machine learning system that simulates how a platform predicts churn in real-time using event-driven architecture.

This project includes:

- Time-based churn modeling (XGBoost, 0.92 ROC-AUC)
- SHAP explainability
- Revenue impact simulator
- Kafka-style partitioned streaming simulation
- Consumer lag monitoring
- Auto-scaling simulation
- Real-time monitoring dashboard

# 🧠 Architecture Overview

Producer → Partitioned Topic Logs → Consumer → Feature Store → ML Model → Dashboard

Key components:

- Event Producer (simulated user activity)
- Kafka-style partitions (log files)
- Consumer with sliding window feature engineering
- Online XGBoost churn scoring
- Lag & throughput monitoring
- Auto-scaling decision engine
- Dark Neon Dashboard

---

# 🎯 Model Performance

- Model: XGBoost
- ROC-AUC: **0.92**

---

# 📊 Revenue Impact Simulation

Simulated retention campaign:

- Baseline churners: 790
- Revenue loss: ~$9,461
- Prevented churn (30% effectiveness): 143 users
- Revenue saved: ~$1,714

---

# ⚡ Streaming Simulation

Simulates Kafka-style architecture:

- 4 partitioned topic logs
- Hash-based partition routing
- Offset tracking
- True consumer lag calculation
- Throughput (events/sec) tracking

---

# 📈 Auto Scaling Logic

Auto-scaler dynamically adjusts consumers based on lag:

- Scale up when lag > threshold
- Scale down when lag stabilizes
- Cooldown protection
- Min/max consumer bounds

---

# 🎨 Dark Neon Dashboard

Features:

- Real-time throughput graph
- Real-time lag trend
- Partition lag distribution
- Churn risk histogram
- Revenue at risk metrics
- Alert banners (Healthy / Warning / Critical)
